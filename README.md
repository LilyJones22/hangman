# Hangman-Type Game in Python
*SDEV140*

This hangman game works by selecting a random word from a list of options and giving the user six attempts to get an incorrect letter<br>
Upon getting a letter that is in the word, the program will fill in all appropriate spaces that that letter belongs<br>
An incorrect letter guess looses one attempt (taking off a part in the traditional hangman game)<br>
<br>
Either correctly guessing the word or running out of attempts will end the game
